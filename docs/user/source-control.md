# Source control

T3 Code integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, Gitea, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps to clone and publish
repositories, create pull requests, and review changes.

## Connect an account

Install Git and configure authentication on the machine running your T3 Code server. For a remote
environment, do this on the remote machine. After signing in, open **Settings → Source Control**
and choose **Rescan**.

### GitHub

Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) 2.81.0 or newer, then sign in:

```bash
gh auth login
```

### Forgejo and Gitea

Install [Forgejo CLI (`fj`)](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/forgejo-cli) or
[Gitea CLI (`tea`)](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) 0.16 or later on your T3 Code server.
Sign in with `fj --host https://your-server auth add-token` or `tea login add`.
Repeat for each server you use, including Codeberg.

T3 Code prefers a matching `fj` login and falls back to `tea` when `fj` is unavailable
or has no login for that server. Once an account is selected, failed actions stay on that
account. Settings shows the detected CLI. Forgejo and Gitea share one integration entry.
Servers hosted under a URL subpath, such as `https://example.com/forgejo`, use `tea` because
fj 0.6 does not preserve the subpath when checking its account.

When cloning or publishing, use a full repository URL to select a specific server.
You can use `owner/repo` when only one fj server is configured, or with your default `tea`
login when fj is unavailable or unconfigured. With multiple fj servers, use the full URL.
If you have multiple `tea` accounts on one server, select one with
`tea login default <login-name>`. Git push and clone also need Git credentials or an SSH key
for that server.

### GitLab

Install [GitLab CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli), then sign in:

```bash
glab auth login
```

### Bitbucket

Set an access token in the server's environment:

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

Or use an Atlassian account email and API token with read/write access to repositories and pull
requests, plus user read access (`read:user:bitbucket`):

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

The access token takes precedence if both are configured. Restart the server after changing these
variables.

### Azure DevOps

Install [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/), add the DevOps extension, and sign in:

```bash
az extension add --name azure-devops
az login
```

## Clone or publish a project

Use **Add Project** in the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) to clone a repository. Choose a hosting
provider or paste a Git URL, then choose where to save it. The project opens right away while the
clone runs in the background: you can write your first prompt, and sending waits until the files
are in place. A toast tracks progress and lets you cancel; if the clone fails, retry it from the
toast or from the banner above the composer.

For a local Git repository without a remote, **Publish Repository** creates a hosted repository,
adds it as `origin`, and pushes your commits. If there are no commits yet, it creates the remote;
make your first commit before pushing.

## Create a pull request

On web and desktop, use the Source Control surface to commit, push, publish a repository, and
create a pull request. Open it from the right sidebar, command palette, or `mod+alt+g`. Its
icon-rail entry uses the detected source-control provider's name when available, such as GitHub;
otherwise it is called Source Control. T3 Code can generate commit messages, review titles, and
descriptions from your changes.

Choose the writing style and model in **Settings → Source Control**. **Repository conventions**
uses the project's instructions and recent commit subjects.

Use **Generate** to draft a message from the reviewed changes. The Generate menu also offers
**Generate with instructions**: enter temporary guidance, then choose **Generate**. Instructions
append to the configured writing prompt by default; select **Replace prompt** when they should
replace it. Closing the popover without generating keeps the text for the next open. Generation
does not change the index and does not require confirmation.

## Stage and commit selected changes

Open **Source Control** from the right sidebar, the command palette, or
`mod+alt+g`. It applies to the active thread's project and checkout. If the project contains
more than one Git repository, choose the repository in the Source Control header; the selection
is remembered for that thread and falls back to the project repository if it disappears. Use
**Refresh repositories** after adding or removing a nested repository.

In **Changes**, stage modified or untracked files before entering a commit message.
The panel commits only staged changes. Use **Unstage** to remove a staged file
from that commit; it keeps the file's working-tree changes. A file marked
**Staged + modified** has both an indexed version and newer unstaged work, so
review the state again before committing.

Large working trees initially show only some changes. The count above the list covers the whole
working tree. Use **Load more changes** until the files you need are listed, then stage or review
each file. During a pending merge with no staged files, use **Review pending merge** to review the
repository-wide merge before committing it.

The panel refreshes the repository after stage and unstage operations. It refuses
a commit when the reviewed branch, index, or merge state changed in the meantime.
If that happens, refresh and review the staged changes again. Older environments
may show the repository status but not support staging or committing from this
panel; update the environment to use those actions.

The commit menu also supports amend, push, pull, and sync where the repository allows them.
Plain Commit, Generate, stage/unstage, view, sort, refresh, and Fetch do not ask for confirmation.
Amend and operations that rewrite, publish, or otherwise mutate the repository ask once before
starting. If a compound action stops partway through, the completed step is shown so you can
continue without repeating a commit.

## History and diffs

The **Graph** tab loads repository history as you scroll. Expand a commit to load its changed
files, then select a file to open its single-file comparison in the secondary pane. The right
sidebar **Diff** surface remains an aggregate view of the selected repository and scope (branch,
working tree, or turn/checkpoint); opening a file does not replace that aggregate view.

## Review and merge

Open **Pull requests** to review changes and comments, request reviewers, check out a branch,
or merge. You can edit review titles and descriptions and your own comments where the host allows it.
GitLab calls these merge requests.

GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps support auto-merge while checks are outstanding. GitHub also
supports approving waiting fork workflows and opening a revert pull request for a merged change.

GitHub sharing is off by default. In Settings → Connections → GitHub sharing (Environments on mobile), choose
**Read PRs** or **Read and act** for each environment you trust to share GitHub access.
Enable both the original environment and the environment answering its requests on this client.
**Read and act** can use broader GitHub permissions than the original environment's credential;
only enable it for environments you control and trust. Changing a saved endpoint or removing an
environment clears its permission.

GitHub review details, linked PR status, and permitted review actions can then use another
connected environment signed in to the same GitHub account. Each needs a project on that host.
A connected local environment is preferred for actions and can answer slow or failed reads.
Browsers and mobile clients need a paired environment to use its GitHub CLI credentials.
Credentials stay on their machines. Previously verified credentials remain usable for routing
for ten minutes during a GitHub outage; new credentials must be verified first. An action with
an uncertain result is never automatically retried elsewhere. Listings, diffs, and checkout or
PR creation from Source Control continues to use the project's environment.

For Azure DevOps, use the host website to view diffs or change comments. Bitbucket does not support
reopening a declined pull request.

## Troubleshooting

- **Not authenticated:** run the provider's login command on the server, then rescan. For Bitbucket,
  confirm the running server received the environment variables.
- **GitHub sign-in cannot be verified:** update GitHub CLI to at least 2.81.0.
- **Push fails despite a connected account:** check the Git remote's credentials. SSH and HTTPS
  remotes can require separate setup from the hosting provider's API access.
- **A review cannot load:** open it on the host website while resolving connectivity, permissions,
  or rate limits.

## Linked pull requests

A thread can hold several pull requests, including reviews from another repository on the same host.
Use **Link pull request** in the command palette or **Linked pull requests** panel, or right-click a
pull request link in the conversation. Creating a pull request from Source Control links it automatically.
Agents can link their pull requests with the `link_pull_request` tool.

Use **Link this PR** in a branch-detected badge's tooltip to keep it with the thread. From a review
on the Pull Requests page, **Link to thread** lets you search for an active thread. The review header
also lists the threads that link to it, including archived threads, so you can return to their context.

Thread badges show a stack's layer count or the current review number with a count of additional
links. On mobile, the Git overview lists linked reviews and their stacks; tap a review to open it.
Linking and unlinking are available in the web and desktop clients.

The **Linked pull requests** panel lists every review and groups stacks. Unlink a review from its
row menu. An unlinked stack layer stays out of later syncs. Open linked reviews refresh on the server;
closed reviews refresh periodically so reopening one on the host is detected. Merged reviews refresh
when requested. With **Auto-settle merged threads** enabled, a thread can settle after every linked
review is terminal. An open or unsynced link keeps it active.

Cross-repository links use a project on the same host. Azure DevOps reviews require a project checked
out from the matching organization and repository.

## GitHub stacks

The Pull Requests page shows each PR's position in its GitHub stack. Open the stack badge in a
review to navigate its layers. **Merge stack** submits the selected pull request and every unmerged
layer below it to GitHub together, respecting branch rules and merge queues. The confirmation shows
the scope and merge strategy. GitHub rebases the remaining stack after merging.

**Rebase stack** updates remote branches from bottom to top without changing your local checkout.
It can rewrite history and restart checks. If a layer fails, earlier updates remain; resolve that
layer before retrying. GitHub may require manual conflict resolution after a lower layer is amended,
even when its changes look independent. Stack actions require an environment that supports them.
